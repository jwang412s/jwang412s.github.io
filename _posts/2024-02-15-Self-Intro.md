Hi! My name is Jerry, and I'm a 5th year Cognitive Systems undergrad student at the University of British Columbia. I have 2 years experience of developing virtual reality experiences for Research and Development projects for both cognitive psychology research and educational tools, and closing in on 1 year of experience with motion capture and virtual production. I am experienced in both Unity and Unreal Engine for virtual reality development, and I am proficient with Maya coupled with PeelSolve, as well as Motionbuilder for motion capture data editing. 


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
