Hi! My name is Jerry, and I'm a 5th year Cognitive Systems undergrad student at the University of British Columbia. I have 2 years experience of developing virtual reality experiences for Research and Development projects for both cognitive psychology research and educational tools, and closing in on 1 year of experience with motion capture and virtual production. I am experienced in both Unity and Unreal Engine for virtual reality development, and I am proficient with Maya coupled with PeelSolve, as well as Motionbuilder for motion capture data editing.
