## Nurse Practioner VR
In healthcare, nurse-patient interaction is of paramount importance. Student Nurse Practitionersâ€™ understanding of theoretical concepts could be improved with a tool that models clinical decision-making through automation. Through virtual reality (VR) technology, students will be able to participate in realistic learning experiences and enhance their communication and clinical skills in a safe and controlled environment.

This project is currently being built in Unreal Engine 5.3.2 for the quest 3, and as the VR developer for this project I implemented the blueprint functions for VR user interactions, and created animation state machines for metahumans to animate their motions according to different game states. I utilized a combination of Livelink facial capture and Nvidia Audio2Face to create facial animations and used Engine-default animations and PoseAI mocap animations for body animations. Created a primitive text analysis function to evaluate the response of Convai, and implemented Speech to Speech using OPENAI API while making use of VaRest, AudioRecognizer, and AudioImporter plugins.

## Vestibuler Assessment VR
The objective of this project was to develop an augmented reality (AR) teaching tool that could enhance instructor demonstrations of the various assessment techniques used to treat BPPV. By creating a 3D interactive model with the vestibular system superimposed onto a head, students are able to better observe and understand how the crystals move as the instructor performs the maneuver using the model.

This was a largely experimental project, but as the Developer, I tested and evaluated handtracking interactions across handheld android AR, Hololens 2, and the quest 2. I ultimately decided on developing for the quest and Implemented the VR user interactions, as well as the physics handler for the crystals moving in the vestibular tubes during the Epley Manuever. This project was built in Unreal Engine 5.1.

## 3D Metabolism VR
The Objective of this project was to transform the student learning experience of the metabolic pathways using virtual reality. 

This project was built in Unity with SteamVR to handle the VR backend. As the developer for this team, I Implemented all user interactions in VR, and integrated the existing assets from the concurrently active 3DM project into the virtual reality build. I also programmed the pathway matching game within the project in C# for the students to evaluate their knowledge of specific metabolic pathways.
